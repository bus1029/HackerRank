Compound Events, Mutually Exclusive Events, and Collectively Exhaustive Events

Let's consider 2 events: A and B. A compound event is a combination of 2 or more simple events.
If A and B are simple events, then A v B denotes the occurrence of either A or B.
Similarly, A ^ B denotes the occurrence of A and B together.

A and B are said to be mutually exclusive or disjoint if they have no events in common.
The probability of any of 2 or more events occurring is the union of events.
Because disjoint probabilities have no common events, the probability of the union of disjoint
events is the sum of the events' individual probabilities.
A and B are said to be to collectively exhaustive if their union covers all events in the sample space. (A u B = S and P(A u B) = 1)
This brings us to our next fundamental rule of probability: if 2 events, A and B, are disjoint,
then the probability of either event is the sum of the probabilities of the 2 events(i.e. P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)).

If the outcome of the first event (A) has no impact on the second event (B), then they are considered to be independent. (e.g. tossing a fair coin)
This brings us to the next fundamental rule of probability: the multiplication rule. It states that if two events,
A and B, are independent, then the probability of both events is the product of the probabilities for each event(i.e., P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)).
The chance of all events occurring in a sequence of events is called the intersection(^) of those events.
