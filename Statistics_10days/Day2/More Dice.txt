Task
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die
will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6.

=>

2 fair six-sided dice => total 36 probabilities
two dice have a sum of 6 => (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1)
different number => (1, 5), (2, 4), (4, 2), (5, 1)

Then, Answer is 1/9
