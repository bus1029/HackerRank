이항분포의 식에서 p(x)가 식으로 계산될 수 없다면 어떻게 해야할까? => Poisson Random Variable

Poisson Experiment
A Poisson experiment is a statistical experiment that has the following properties:
- The outcome of each trial is either success or failure.
- The average number of successes (l: lambda) that occurs in a specified region is known.
- The probability that a success will occur is proportional to the size of the region.
- The probability that a success will occur in an extremely small region is virtually zero.



Poisson Distribution
A Poisson random variable is the number of successes that result from a Poisson experiment.
The probability distribution of a Poisson random variable is called Poisson distribution:

    P(k, l: lambda) = l**k * exp(-l) / k!

Here,
- e = 2.71828
- l is the average number of successes that occur in a specified region.
- k is the actual number of successes that occur in a specified region.
- P(k, l) is the Poisson probability, which is the probability of getting exactly k successes when the
average number of successes is l.


Special Case
Consider some Poisson random variable, X. Let E[X] be the expectation of X. Find the value of E[X**2].

Let Var(X) be the variance of X. Recall that if a random variable has a Poisson distribution, then:

- E[X] = l(lambda)
- Var(X) = l

Now, we'll use the following property of expectation and variance for any random variable, X:

    Var(X) = E[X**2] - (E[X])**2
    => E[X**2] = Var(X) + (E[X])**2

So, for any random variable X having a Poisson distribution, the above result can be rewritten as:
    => E[X**2] = l + l**2
