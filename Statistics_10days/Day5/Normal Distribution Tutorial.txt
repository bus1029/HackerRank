Normal Distribution
The probability density of normal distribution is:

    N(m, s**2) = (1 / s * math.sqrt(2 * math.PI)) * math.exp(-((x - m)**2) / 2 * s**2)

Here,
- m is the mean (or expectation) of the distribution. It is also equal to median and mode of the distribution.
- s**2 is the variance.
- s is the standard deviation.



Standard Normal Distribution
if m = 0 and s = 1, then the normal distribution is known as standard normal distribution:

    o(x) = math.exp(-(x**2 / 2)) / math.sqrt(2 * math.PI)

Every normal distribution can be represented as standard normal distribution:

    N(m, s**2) = 1/s * o((x-m) / s)
