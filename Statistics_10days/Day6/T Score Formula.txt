The Central Limit Theorem requires the following assumptions

- The sample size of N is large enough(more than 30 points usually)

- Every data point in the entire population is normally distributed with the same mean m
and the same standard deviation s (this is the not the so-called "population standard deviation")

- The sample size is less than 10% of the total population size (to ensure every
data point comes independently).

Then the sample mean is also normally distributed with same mean as the population mean m, and
standard deviation as s / N**0.5

In practice, there are two different cases:

1. When the standard deviation of population s is known.
2. When s is unknown.

For the first case, we use the z-score for hypothesis test, as well as the confidence interval,
since the sample mean x_ is already normally distributed.

For the second case, we use the t-score and t-distributed for hypothesis test and
confidence interval. Here, since we don't have s. We use the sample standard deviation s to
approximate s. That is why the quantity

    z = x_ - m / (x / N**0.5)

is no longer normally distributed. It follows the t-distribution with freedom of degree N - 1.
The 1.96 is the critical value of the t-distribution for the 95% confidence interval
(two-tailed p-value = 0.95).

From the wording of the question, I actually can't tell whether m and s are from the population or the sample.
But the 1.96 is definitely the critical value of 95% confidence interval from the t-distribution.
