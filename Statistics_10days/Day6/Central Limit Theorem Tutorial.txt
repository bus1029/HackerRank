Central Limit Theorem

The central limit theorem (CLT) states that, for a large enough sample (n), the distribution of the sample
mean will approach normal distribution. This holds for a sample of independent random variables from any
distribution with a finite standard deviation.

Let {X1, X2, X3, ..., Xn} be a random data set of size n, that is, a sequence of independent and identically
distributed random variables drawn from distribution of expected values given by m and finite variances
given by s**2. The sample average is:

    S_n := sum([Xi]) / N

For large n, the distribution of sample sums S_n is close to normal distribution N(m', s') where:

    - m' = n * m
    - s' = n**0.5 * s
