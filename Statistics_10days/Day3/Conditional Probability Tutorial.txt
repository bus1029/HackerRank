Conditional Probability

This is defined as the probability of an event occurring, assuming that one or more other events have already occurred.
Two events, A and B are considered to be independent if event A has no effect on the probability of event B.
If events A and B are not independent, then we must consider the probability that both events occur.

This can be referred to as the intersection of events A and B, defined as P(A ^ B) = P(B|A) * P(A).
We can then use this definition to find the conditional probability by dividing the probability of the
intersection of the two events (A ^ B) by the probability of the event that is assumed to have already occurred(event A)

P(B|A) = P(A^B) / P(A)


Bayes' Theorem
Let A and B be two events such that P(A|B) denotes the probability of the occurrence of A given that B has
occurred and P(B|A) denotes the probability of the occurrence of B given that A has occurred, then

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|Ac) * P(Ac)
