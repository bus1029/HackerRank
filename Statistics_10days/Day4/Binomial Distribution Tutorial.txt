Bernoulli Random Variable and Distribution

The sample space of a binomial experiment only contains two points, s(success) and f(failure).
We define a Bernoulli random variable to be the random variable defined by X(s) = 1 and X(f) = 0.
If we consider the probability of success to be p and the probability of failure to be q(where q = 1-p),
then the probability mass function(PMF) of X is:

            f(x) = p**x * (1-p)**(1-x), for x {0, 1}


Binomial Distribution

We define a binomial process to be a binomial experiment meeting the following conditions:

- The number of successes is x.
- The total number of trials is n.
- The probability of success of 1 trial is p.
- The probability of failure of 1 trial q, where p = 1 - q.
- b(x, n, p) is the binomial probability, meaning the probability of having exactly x successes out of n trials.

The binomial random variable is the number of successes, x, out of n trials.

The binomial distribution is the probability distribution for the binomial random variable, given by the following
probability mass function:

            b(x, n, p) = nCx * p**x * q**(n-x)
