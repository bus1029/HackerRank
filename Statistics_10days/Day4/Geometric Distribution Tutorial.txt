Negative Binomial Experiment

A negative binomial experiment is a statistical experiment that has following properties:
- The experiment consists of n repeated trials.
- The trials are independent.
- The outcome of each trial is either success(s) or failure(f).
- P(s) is the same for every trial.
- The experiment continues until x successes are observed.

If X is the number of experiments until the xth success occurs, then X is a discrete random variable
called negative binomial.



Negative Binomial Distribution
Consider the following probability mass function:

    b*(x, n, p) = n-1Cx-1 * p**x * q**(n-x)

The function above is negative binomial and has the following properties:
- The number of successes to be observed is x.
- The total number of trials is n.
- The probability of success of 1 trial is p.
- The probability of failure of 1 trial q, where q = 1-p
- b*(x, n, p) is the negative binomial probability, meaning the probability of having x-1 successes after n-1 trials
and having x successes after n trials.



Geometric Distribution
The geometric distribution is a special case of the negative binomial distribution that
deals with the number of Bernoulli trials required to get a success(i.e., counting the number of failures
before the first success). Recall that X is the number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trials,
so for each i (where 1 <= i <= n):

Xi = 1 if the ith trial is a success
     0 otherwise.

The geometric distribution is a negative binomial distribution where the number of successes is 1.
We express this with the following formula:

    g(n, p) = q**(n-1) * p
