Covariance

This is a measure of how two random variables change together, or the strength of their correlation.

Consider two random variables, X and Y, each with n values(i.e., x1, x2, ..., xn and y1, y2, ..., yn).
The covariance of X and Y can be found using either of the following equivalent formulas:

    cov(X, Y) = 1/n * sum((x[i] - x_m) * (y[i] - y_m))

    cov(X, Y) = 1/n**2 * sum((x[i] - x[j]) * (y[i] - y[j])) (j > i)

Here, x_m is the mean of X and y_m is the mean of Y.



Person Correlation Coefficient
The Pearson correlation coefficient, p_X,Y, given by:

    p_X,Y = sum((x[i] - x_m) * (y[i] - y_m)) / n * s_x * y_s

Here, s_x is the standard deviation of X and s_y is the standard deviation of Y. You may also see p_X,Y written as
r_X,Y
